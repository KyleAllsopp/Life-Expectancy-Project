# Life-Expectancy-Project
The Life Expectancy Project is a group project I completed during my Master's studies at Brandeis University. The overarching project is broken up into two components Global Life Expectancy and EU Life Expectancy but in this drive you will see the components of the global project. For this project you will find R-Markdown code, csv data, and a final report consisting of our Tableau and other visuals we compiled for this project. My role in this project was to organize all visuals which is why you will primarily see visualizations in most of my code here. 


Other group members who contributed to this project: Salman Haider, Sana Ijaz, Erick Amezcua, and Maria Navarro Castillo.
